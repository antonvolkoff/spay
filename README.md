###Hello there!

Few notes:
* I have actually added more than 3 fields to the form in case it's needed to
change some data.
* I don't display error messages, just no offers in case of an type of error, it's not good
* In tests for model I make real requests otherwise in requests(features) I mock them
* I don't do caching thought I docs it says I should. I thinks that will work in this case.
* I had fun!

Now, enjoy your day!
